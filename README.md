# yew-d3-example

Example showing a d3 chart with [Yew](https://github.com/yewstack/yew)

![Chart image](img/screenshot.png)

Instructions:

Follow the Yew setup instrunctions (I use [trunk](https://yew.rs/docs/en/next/getting-started/project-setup/using-trunk)).

Then run
```sh
trunk serve
```
in the project's root folder.

Open http://127.0.0.1:8080 in a web browser.

*Note: I'm using Yew's master branch, because I had issues with the `html` macro in the latest release version. It seems also necessary to use trunk.
